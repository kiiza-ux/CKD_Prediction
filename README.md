# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a patient has Chronic kidney disease(CKD) based on various medical attributes.The dataset contains 400 patient records with 25 features.

## Requirements
-Python 3.x
-Libraries: pandas,numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

## How to Run
Clone the repository.
Install the requred libraries using 'pip install-requirements.text'
Run the jupyter notebook 'CKD_Prediction.ipynb'.

## Results
-The Random Forest Classifier achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.
-Cross-validation results showed high accuracy, indicating a robust model.

## Future work
-Explore other machine learning models.
-Perform hyperparameter tuning.
-Deploy the model for real-world use.
